## 💡 What This Solves

### The Problem
Roofing companies waste **5-10 hours weekly** on manual insurance claim documentation:
- 30 min organizing photos
- 45 min documenting damage
- 60 min creating reports
- 30 min tracking follow-ups

**= 165 minutes per inspection**

### The Solution
Automated workflow reduces this to **5 minutes**:
- 2 min uploading & organizing
- 1 min reviewing AI analysis
- 1 min generating PDF
- 1 min setting up tracking

**= 160 minutes saved per inspection!**

### The Impact

**Time Savings:**
- Per week (4 inspections): 10.7 hours
- Per year: 556 hours

**Financial Impact:**
- Labor savings (at $50/hr): $27,800/year
- Additional capacity: 185 inspections/year
- Revenue potential: $925,000/year

**ROI: Immediate and infinite** (nearly zero cost)
