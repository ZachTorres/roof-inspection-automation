## The Problem We Solved

### Manual Process Breakdown

Roofing companies were losing **5-10 hours weekly** on:

| Task | Time | Pain Point |
|------|------|------------|
| Photo organization | 30 min | Manual sorting and naming |
| Damage documentation | 45 min | Writing detailed descriptions |
| Cost estimation | 20 min | Calculating repair costs |
| Report formatting | 60 min | Creating professional PDFs |
| Follow-up tracking | 30 min | Managing multiple claims |
| **TOTAL** | **165 min** | **Per inspection!** |

### Business Impact

- **Lost revenue**: Time not spent on actual roofing work
- **Delayed claims**: Slow documentation = delayed insurance payments
- **Inconsistent quality**: Manual reports vary by inspector
- **Missed follow-ups**: No system for tracking claim progress
- **Employee frustration**: Administrative burden on field staff
